		<h1 class="side-header">Ownership</h1>
		<p class="prvcy-polcy-text">The Website is owned and operated by RNYOO and its licensors, and the Information and Services (and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto) are and will remain the property of RNYOO and its licensors and suppliers. The Information and Services are protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, and other laws, and you acknowledge that these rights are valid and enforceable. Except as set forth in this Agreement, you may not copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, republish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, sub-license, sell, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Website or any Service or Information without our prior written permission.

Use of the Website or any Services or Information for any other purpose is strictly prohibited. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Website or any Services or Information.<br>
		The trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed on the Website (collectively, the "Trademarks") are the [registered and unregistered] trademarks of RNYOO, RNYOO licensors and suppliers, and/or others. RNYOO® is a registered trademark of RNYOO, Inc. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Website should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark(s) without the express written permission of RNYOO, RNYOO licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark, except as set forth in the following paragraph.</p>
		<h1 class="side-header">No Use by Children Under 13</h1>
		<p class="prvcy-polcy-text">You hereby affirm that you are over the age of 12, as this Website is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then you may not use the Website. You further affirm that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and to abide by and comply with this Agreement.</p>
		<h1 class="side-header">Claims of Copyright or Trademark Infringement</h1>
		<p class="prvcy-polcy-text">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. RNYOO also reviews claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by RNYOO infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks located on the Website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow RNYOO to locate the material on the Website; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that RNYOO will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If RNYOO determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, RNYOO will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the materials unlawful.<br>
		If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which RNYOO may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).<br>
		Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Website must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details) and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
