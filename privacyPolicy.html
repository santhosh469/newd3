		<div class="prvcy-polcy-content">
			<p class="prvcy-polcy-text">We designed this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to help you understand what information RNYOO collects, how RNYOO uses it, how it may be shared, and what choices you have.

			Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").</p>
			<h1 class="side-header">Collection and Use of Information</h1>
			<p class="prvcy-polcy-text">

			<span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Communications:</span> When you join RNYOO by signing up for an account or creating a profile, as permitted by law, you are opting in to receive emails from us or about RNYOO. You can manage your email and notice preferences through your account settings. Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative or legal notices from us. If you exchange messages with others through the Website, in accordance with applicable law, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Website. RNYOO may also enable you to connect, at your initiation, outside the Website via your personal email address to third-party providers of products and services who you wish to contact outside of the Website.<br>
			<span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Transactional Information:</span> If you purchase products within the Website, certain information collected for processing your request, such as your phone number, address, email, and credit card information, may be shared with relevant third-parties in order for them to process your request (but not for their own marketing or other purposes). When you submit credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using industry standard technology and use commercially reasonable security measures to protect it from misuse.<br>
			<span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Website Activity/Automatically Collected Information:</span> We collect and may store information about your use of the Website, such as your search activity, the pages you view, and the date and time of your visit. We also collect and may store information that your computer or mobile device provides to us in connection with your use of the Website, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, mobile carrier, unique device identifier, location, and requested and referring URLs, discussed below in our Tracking Technology Section.<br>
			<span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Linked Networks and Contacts:</span> You can elect to connect your RNYOO profile to other networks such as Facebook or Google, and, if you so choose, you will be asked to enable sharing of your contact information from that network to RNYOO and to enable sharing of your activities on RNYOO on that network.<br></p>
			<h1 class="side-header">Tracking Technologies</h1>
			<p class="prvcy-polcy-text"><span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Cookies and Similar Technologies:</span>
			When you visit the Website, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use RNYOO and provide features to you.
			We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.<br>
			<span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Log File Information</span>
			Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
			When you use our Website, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

			When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Website, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers."

			A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Website and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.<br>
			<span class="prvcy-polcy-points">Metadata</span>
			Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of Content was collected and how that content is formatted.<br>
			Users can add or may have Metadata added to their Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your Content more searchable and interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.<br>
